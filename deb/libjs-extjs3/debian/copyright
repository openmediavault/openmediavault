 Commercial License
 ------------------
 .
 http://www.extjs.com/products/license.php
 .
 This is the appropriate option if you are creating proprietary applications and you are not prepared to distribute and share the source code of your application under the GPL.
 .
    * Based on the "Quid Pro Quo" principle, if you wish to derive a commercial advantage by not releasing your application under an open source license, you must purchase an appropriate number of commercial licenses from Ext. By purchasing commercial licenses, you are no longer obligated to publish your source code.
 .
 Commercial licenses:
 .
    * Are on a per developer basis. Each person who directly or indirectly creates an application or user interface containing Ext components is considered a developer.
    * Are perpetual and include upgrades to all minor revisions. For example: a 3.0 license includes all publicly 3.x releases including 3.0, 3.1, 3.3, etc.
    * Do not include access to patch releases until they are rolled up into the next minor release. For example: the 3.0.3 patch release will be available to commercial licensees when 3.1 is released.
    * Are royalty-free.
    * Remove any obligations to release any source code under GPL.
