Description: openmediavault Kubernetes plugin
 Kubernetes is an open-source platform for orchestrating and
 managing containerized applications in an automated, scalable,
 and resource-efficient environment.
 The plugin is intended to implement a single-node Kubernetes
 environment using SUSE K3s.
 The plugin comes with preinstalled Traefik, Cert-Manager and
 Kubernetes Dashboard.
 By default the LoadBalancer resource is listening on port 8080
 (HTTP) and 8443 (HTTPS).
