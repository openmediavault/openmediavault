#
# The values set in /etc/apticron/apticron.conf will override the settings
# in this file.

#
# Set EMAIL to a space separated list of addresses which will be notified of
# impending updates. By default the root account will be notified.
#
EMAIL="root"

#
# Set DIFF_ONLY to "1" to only output the difference of the current run
# compared to the last run (ie. only new upgrades since the last run). If there
# are no differences, no output/email will be generated. By default, apticron
# will output everything that needs to be upgraded.
#
# DIFF_ONLY="1"
#
DIFF_ONLY="0"

#
# Set LISTCHANGES_PROFILE if you would like apticron to invoke apt-listchanges
# with the --profile option. You should add a corresponding profile to
# /etc/apt/listchanges.conf
#
# LISTCHANGES_PROFILE="apticron"
#
# By default apt-listchanges is run with no profile
#
LISTCHANGES_PROFILE=""

#
# From hostname manpage: "Displays  all FQDNs of the machine. This option
# enumerates all configured network addresses on all configured network inter‚Äê
# faces, and translates them to DNS domain names. Addresses that cannot be
# translated (i.e. because they do not have an appropriate  reverse DNS
# entry) are skipped. Note that different addresses may resolve to the same
# name, therefore the output may contain duplicate entries. Do not make any
# assumptions about the order of the output."
#
# By default only the first FQDN is used
#
# ALL_FQDNS="1"
ALL_FQDNS="0"

#
# Set SYSTEM if you would like apticron to use something other than the output
# of "hostname -f" for the system name in the mails it generates. This option
# overrides the ALL_FQDNS above.
#
# SYSTEM="foobar.example.com"
#
SYSTEM=$(/bin/hostname -f)

#
# Set IPADDRESSNUM if you would like to configure the maximal number of IP
# addresses apticron displays. The default is to display 1 address of each
# family type (inet, inet6), if available.
#
IPADDRESSNUM="1"

#
# Set IPADDRESSES to a whitespace separated list of reachable addresses for
# this system. If unset or empty, apticron will try to work these out using
# the "ip" command.
#
# IPADDRESSES="192.0.2.1 2001:db8:1:2:3::1"
#
IPADDRESSES=""

#
# Set NOTIFY_HOLDS="0" if you don't want to be notified about new versions of
# packages on hold in your system. The default behavior is downloading and
# listing them as any other package.
#
# NOTIFY_HOLDS="0"
#
NOTIFY_HOLDS="1"

#
# Set NOTIFY_NEW="0" if you don't want to be notified about packages which
# are not installed in your system. Yes, it's possible! There are some issues
# related to systems which have mixed stable/unstable sources. In these cases
# apt-get will consider for example that packages with "Priority:
# required"/"Essential: yes" in unstable but not in stable should be installed,
# so they will be listed in dist-upgrade output. Please take a look at
# http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=531002#44
#
# NOTIFY_NEW="0"
#
NOTIFY_NEW="1"

#
# Set NOTIFY_NO_UPDATES="1" if you want to be notified when there are no
# new versions. This is useful to assure you that apticron works well.
# By default notifications will be sent only when new versions are available.
#
# NOTIFY_NO_UPDATES="1"
#
NOTIFY_NO_UPDATES="0"

#
# Set CUSTOM_SUBJECT if you want to replace the default subject used in
# the notification e-mails. This may help filtering/sorting client-side e-mail.
# If you want to use internal vars please use single quotes here. Ex:
# CUSTOM_SUBJECT='[apticron] $SYSTEM: $NUM_PACKAGES package update(s)'
#
CUSTOM_SUBJECT="\${NUM_PACKAGES} package update(s) available"

#
# Set CUSTOM_NO_UPDATES_SUBJECT if you want to replace the default subject used
# in the no update notification e-mails. This may help filtering/sorting
# client-side e-mail.
# If you want to use internal vars please use single quotes here. Ex:
# CUSTOM_NO_UPDATES_SUBJECT='[apticron] $SYSTEM: no updates'
#
CUSTOM_NO_UPDATES_SUBJECT="No package updates available"

#
# Set CUSTOM_FROM if you want to replace the default sender by changing the
# 'From:' field used in the notification e-mails.
#
# CUSTOM_FROM=""

# Set GPG_ENCRYPT="1" if you want to encrypt the mail being send to
# $EMAIL. apticron will use gpg and the public key of the recipient to encrypt
# the mail. Please note that the $EMAIL value above can't be an alias, since
# gpg will trust it to encrypt the message.

GPG_ENCRYPT="0"
