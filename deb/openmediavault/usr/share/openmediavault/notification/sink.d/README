Put your notification sink scripts here. This can be a Perl, Python, PHP,
Shell or any other script/executable.

If a system notification is send via email, then the notification system is
triggered and all scripts located in this directory are executed. This way
it is possible to support additional notification systems beside email.

The following environment variables are set and can be used:

OMV_NOTIFICATION_FROM
OMV_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT
OMV_NOTIFICATION_SUBJECT
OMV_NOTIFICATION_DATE
OMV_NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE_FILE

Additionally the scripts/executables are executed with the following command
line arguments:

$1 The path of the file containing the message text (OMV_NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE_FILE)
$2 The FROM email address (OMV_NOTIFICATION_FROM)
$3 The TO recipient email addresses (OMV_NOTIFICATION_RECIPIENT)

Please note, because of security reasons the scripts are executed with the
dedicated system user/group 'openmediavault-notify'.
