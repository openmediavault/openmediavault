This module allows you to spawn processes, connect to their
input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.

It redirects the function calls to the functions provided by
the subprocess module. The only difference is that this module
takes care that the 'env' keyword argument is set and the
'LANG' environment variable is set to 'C'. This is because
we always want to have not localized command output to do not
get error message in foreign languages that the maintainers
do not understand.
