msgid "Implicit SSL"
msgstr ""

msgid "In some cases you have to specify passive ports range to by-pass firewall limitations. Passive ports restricts the range of ports from which the server will select when sent the PASV command from a client. The server will randomly choose a number from within the specified range until an open port is found. The port range selected must be in the non-privileged range (eg. greater than or equal to 1024). It is strongly recommended that the chosen range be large enough to handle many simultaneous passive connections (for example, 49152-65534, the IANA-registered ephemeral port range)."
