"In some cases you have to specify passive ports range to by-pass firewall "

" randomly choose a number from within the specified range until an open port"
" is found. The port range selected must be in the non-privileged range (eg. "
"greater than or equal to 1024). It is strongly recommended that the chosen "
"range be large enough to handle many simultaneous passive connections (for "
"example, 49152-65534, the IANA-registered ephemeral port range)."
