Description: openmediavault disk monitoring plugin
 The disk monitoring plugin collects performance statistics of hard-disks.
 !!! Note !!!
 For the statistics to function correctly, stable kernel device name
 assignment for the drives to be monitored must be ensured across reboots.
 This can be accomplished with user-defined Udev rules that must be
 created by the user.
